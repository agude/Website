                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>I was born in California and lived most of my life in the San Francisco Bay Area. I became interested in physics in middle school and decided then that I wanted to study it in college. I attended UC Berkeley from 2004 to 2008, graduating with honors with a B.A. in Physics. While at Berkeley, I worked with <a href="http://www.physics.berkeley.edu/research/faculty/perlmutter.html">Saul Perlmutter</a> and the <a href="http://supernova.lbl.gov/">Supernova Cosmology Project</a>. With the SCP, I wrote an undergraduate thesis on supernova spectra.</p>
                    <p>In 2009, I began attending the University of Minnesota as a graduate student in physics, with an interest in experimental high energy physics.</p>

                    <h2>Research</h2>
                    <p>I currently work with <a href="https://www.physics.umn.edu/people/jmmans.html">Jeremiah Mans</a> as a member of the <a href="https://cms.web.cern.ch/cms/index.html">Compact Muon Solenoid Experiment (CMS)</a>, a particle detector on the highest energy particle accelerator in the world: the Large Hadron Collider. As part of the collaboration, I have performed worked on the High Level Trigger and Hadronic Calorimeter subsystems. I am also working on two analyses using data from CMS. The first analysis is a measurement of the properties of the Z boson; one of the force carriers of the weak force. Measuring the properties of the Z bosons allows physicists to better understand the interaction of the two protons at the moment of their collision in the middle of CMS. The second analysis is the search for a right handed W boson and heavy neutrino.  Finding such a particle would give us clues as to why the weak force has a broken symmetry at low energies; a feature that has been observed but not explained.</p>
